                <h1>To be completely honest, I made this to prove a point. This project has taken 2 days. And soon well be progressed.</h1><br>
                <h1>What point? Well, I was in class at the end of the day. We were watching Last Kids On Earth While packing up. I saw an '?' in the netflix url.</h1><br>
                <h1>A '?' what is that. Well, I must go into detail. in an url, a '?' is defined that the rest of the url are params.</h1><br>
                <h1>Us Web Developers use web parameters to define details like account ids, links, password, ids, etc. So, i took the challenge of making this.</h1><br>
                <h1>And well look. your looking at this right now! and thats about it. if you have any issues please go to my issue page.</h1><br>
